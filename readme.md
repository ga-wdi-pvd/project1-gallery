Things you'd like specific feedback on:
1. I used functions to avoid nested conditional logic. Are there too many? is there a better way to do this?
2. Were the userCounter and simonCounter variable neccessay? They were used to get values from arrays ex simonSeq[simonCounter], was there a better way?
3. Alternative approaches.
```
