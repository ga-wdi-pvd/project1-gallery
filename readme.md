Things you'd like specific feedback on:

I wanted to fetch my database of questions from a published google docs 
spreadsheet. It was working on my local machine, but once deployed I was 
getting "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" errors. Is there a general way to 
avoid this, without resorting to plugins. I'm currently fetching from a 
locally stored file, which seems to work (although it didn't work on my 
local machine without jumping through hoops).

I know the code for this project could be cleaned up significantly.
