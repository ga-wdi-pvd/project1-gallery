Include the following in your submission

```
Link to repo: https://github.com/MurphyPicard/Simon-the-game-
Link to deployed app: https://murphypicard.github.io/Simon-the-game-/

Things you'd like specific feedback on:  I know I need to change lots of little things.
But I'm happy it is working, even if it looks rough.  I need help nesting functions
and I need help creating functions that aren't DRY.
