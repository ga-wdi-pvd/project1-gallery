Things you'd like specific feedback on:

I wanted to fetch my database of questions from a published google docs spreadsheet. It was working on my local machine, but once deployed I was getting "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" errors. Is there a general way to avoid this, without resorting to plugins. I'm currently fetching from a locally stored file, which seems to work (although it didn't work on my local machine without jumping through hoops).

I know the code for this project could be cleaned up significantly.
